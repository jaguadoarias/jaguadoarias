### UI/UX Developer 
#### with more than 15 years of experience building and styling components and interfaces in different web development projects.

I really enjoy working close to the design team, giving my feedback before introducing the designs in the development process. I love to work with components inside a UI Library, being responsible for implementing the best look and feel as CSS/HTML developer, controlling their visual status through snapshots and testing them with react testing library. I like to document components through Storybook and document every feature implementation with any kind of process.

Iâ€™m a specialist in responsive web design using cross-browser techniques and a pixel-perfect obsessed. I use and love to work with typographies, icons, colors, design tokens, SVG, inside a design system. 

Every day trying to improve my knowledge about react, typescript, web prototyping with Figma and web accessibility. With agile methodologies inside a pod/squad ðŸš€.
