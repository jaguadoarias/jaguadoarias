### UI Frontend Developer · Design Engineer


I’m a UI Frontend Developer combining solid frontend engineering skills with deep expertise in Modern CSS methodologies, style architectures, and Design Systems. 
I specialize in building scalable UI foundations, developing React/Typescript components, defining engineering patterns, and collaborating across product teams to deliver high-quality interfaces.

With 15+ years of experience, I focus on turning design into production-ready user experiences: reusable components, well-structured styles, stable foundations, and visually accurate interfaces. I really enjoy being the bridge between design and engineering, staying involved in the design handoff process, translating design tokens into code, ensuring pixel-perfect results, improving accessibility, and helping maintain consistent patterns across teams and platforms.

I like to collaborate actively through thoughtful PR reviews and helping keep documentation clear, useful, and up to date.

Always trying to learn and improve my skills in React, TypeScript, Modern CSS, Figma prototyping, and web accessibility. 
Working with agile methodologies inside a pod/squad 🚀.
