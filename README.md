### UI/UX Developer 
#### with more than 15 years of experience building and styling components and interfaces in different web development projects.

I really enjoy working close to the design team, giving my feedback before introducing the designs in the development process. I love to work with components inside a UI Library, being responsible for implementing the best look and feel as CSS/HTML developer, controlling their visual status through snapshot testing (using Jest), and documenting them through Storybook or another kind of tool for documentation.

Iâ€™m a specialist in responsive web design using cross-browser techniques and a pixel-perfect obsessed. I use to work with typographies, icons, colors, SVG, and vector graphics inside a design system. Every day trying to improve my knowledge about Web Prototyping (Sketch and Figma) and Web Accessibility.
